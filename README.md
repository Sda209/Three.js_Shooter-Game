# Three.js_Shooter-Game
A shooting game made in JavaScript, Three.js

At the moment, the game only displays the player's starting weapon -- a rough sketch model of a rifle (probably will change into a pistol in the final verison) -- but it is currently under development into a playable prototype at the time of this writing.
